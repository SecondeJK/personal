# PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

** 1. Competence of Symfony **

Changing from traditional "spaghetti" applications written in PHP to proper frameworks using advanced tools has been a major step. Every new developer for in this discipline must adopt a starting language and subsequent framework. My language choice was PHP. Symfony is my preferred framework. There is no concrete reason for this, other than quite a few networking discussions with other developers about the learning curve of Zend Framework being sharper. It is possible I may learn Laravel in time, but for me, Symfony is widely used, I've had training from SensioLabs and am comfortable it's taking me forward.

Concepts of Symfony

- Implimentation of Service Containers
- Full example use of Doctrine to CRUD from Symfony to MySQL
- Integration of Twitter bootstrap to speed up form and web development
- Understanding of multiple controllers and multiple routes in YAML markup

These concepts will be proved from fresh code on a basic project hosted here.
