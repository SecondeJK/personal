# PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Disclaimer: these have changed dramatically since my move from London to Birmingham. As a result, a lot of updating needed to be done.

### 1. Competence of Symfony --IN PROGRESS-- ###

Still outstanding:

1. Forms, and specifically more serviced based forms. All sorts of CRUD operations
2. More to come.

### 2. Docker ###

1. I have a big problem with Docker: my machine can't run it due to Core Duo motherboard. This might have to happen on my iMac.

### 3. Javascript: Test Application (Front) ###

1. I need to build a basic test App frontend through a commonly used Framework. At the moment either Angular or React seem like the most obvious options.

### 4. Javascript: Test Application (Back) ###

1. I need to build a basic test App backend so I can get to grips with various JS techs. As it's currently the most used, this will be Express.

2. Build a node.js basic REST

3. Build something that uses WebSockets.

### 5. PHPStorm ###

This application is extremely difficult to get to grips with the vast amount of customisation it offers. Master it, and once that is done, do a talk on it.

### 5. Laravel ###

Despite much distaste for this framework, I need to use one outside of Symfony. Curiously, recent statistics have pointed to Laravel really going mad on uptake. This is puzzling considering it's strange implementation, but I shall build out an example app anyway to see how someone else does it.
