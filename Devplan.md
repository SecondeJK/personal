# PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

### 1. Competence of Symfony ###

Changing from traditional "spaghetti" applications written in PHP to proper frameworks using advanced tools has been a major step. Every new developer for in this discipline must adopt a starting language and subsequent framework. My language choice was PHP. Symfony is my preferred framework. There is no concrete reason for this, other than quite a few networking discussions with other developers about the learning curve of Zend Framework being sharper. It is possible I may learn Laravel in time, but for me, Symfony is widely used, I've had training from SensioLabs and am comfortable it's taking me forward.

Concepts of Symfony

- Implimentation of Service Containers
- Full example use of Doctrine to CRUD from Symfony to MySQL
- Integration of Twitter bootstrap to speed up form and web development
- Understanding of multiple controllers and multiple routes in YAML markup

These concepts will be proved from fresh code on a basic project hosted here.

### 2. PHP Unit ###

I tried Netbeans integration with this and it was very confusing, and contradicted PHPunit's own Implimentation guidelines. PHPUnit out the box is seems the best route. I can't get it to work, I need an application specifically to write unit tests.

### 3. Revisit the basics of OOP ###

I STILL haven't had that magic click where I can read methods, objects and constructors like they're in English. CodeAcademy does a free course on this, I WILL master this until I can read it automatically.
