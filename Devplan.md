# PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Disclaimer: these have changed dramatically since my move from London to Birmingham. As a result, a lot of updating needed to be done.

### 1. Symfony --IN PROGRESS-- ###

Still outstanding:

1. Forms, and specifically more serviced based forms. All sorts of CRUD operations
2. Scraper - build a basic scraper app
3. FOSBundle - build a basic app with multiple users baked in.

### 2. Docker ###

1. I have a big problem with Docker: my machine can't run it due to Core Duo motherboard. This might have to happen on my iMac.

### 3. Javascript: Test Competencies ###

1. One page, front end site developed using Angular.

### 4. Javascript: Test Application (Back) ###

1. Build a node.js basic REST using Express

2. Build something that uses WebSockets.

### 5. PHPStorm ###

This application is extremely difficult to get to grips with the vast amount of customisation it offers. Master it, and once that is done, do a talk on it to CA

### 6. Laravel ###

Despite much distaste for this framework, I need to use one outside of Symfony. Curiously, recent statistics have pointed to Laravel really going mad on uptake. This is puzzling considering it's strange implementation, but I shall build out an example app anyway to see how someone else does it.
