# PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

### 1. Competence of Symfony --IN PROGRESS-- ###

Changing from traditional "spaghetti" applications written in PHP to proper frameworks using advanced tools has been a major step. Every new developer for in this discipline must adopt a starting language and subsequent framework. My language choice was PHP. Symfony is my preferred framework. There is no concrete reason for this, other than quite a few networking discussions with other developers about the learning curve of Zend Framework being sharper. It is possible I may learn Laravel in time, but for me, Symfony is widely used, I've had training from SensioLabs and am comfortable it's taking me forward.

Concepts of Symfony

- Implimentation of Service Containers
- Full example use of Doctrine to CRUD from Symfony to MySQL
- Integration of Twitter bootstrap to speed up form and web development
- Understanding of multiple controllers and multiple routes in YAML markup

These concepts will be proved from fresh code on a basic project hosted here.

08/03/2016:
Sandbox Symfony is installed and uploaded to GIT. Revisiting training from Inviqua to go through the Symfony getting stated guide.

20/04/2016:
Work started to create a form to take HTTP POST data and turn it into an object.

28/06/2016:
Extreme Symfony learning on it's way, as the work app has a long term goal in migrating to Symfony

03/08/2016:
About to start building a Symfony application that uses Doctrine to CRUD something as per work engineer guidance.

11/09/2016:
Finished Doctrine. ORM that really does look lovely!

30/12/2016:
Switched to Service-Oriented Architecture.
Need to start looking at the form builder.

### 2. PHP Unit ### --IN PROGRESS--

I tried Netbeans integration with this and it was very confusing, and contradicted PHPunit's own Implimentation guidelines. PHPUnit out the box is seems the best route. I can't get it to work, I need an create an application specifically to write unit tests.

03/08/2016 - Test Driven Development is on the agenda of work talks, and for major developments is due to be adopted as the primary coding style.

15/12/2016:
Started using PHPUnit, hopefully will be given a task soon that will require TDD. The implimentation of it isn't actually that complex.

20/12/2016:
Started writing PHPUnit tests. API Book has also shown me Behat syntax for BDD or TDD with more readabe code. These have been pushed into the codebase and are active.

### 3. Revisit the basics of OOP in PHP --COMPLETED--

Might as well include that this was completed some time ago, and now this section is covered by ongoing progress in leaning Python's Object Orientation techniques/methods/constructors.

### 4. Interactive BIRT Objects ### --SCRAPPED DUE TO EMPLOYMENT--

Binned. The reality of this with interactive dashboards is that BIRT is in the bin and Javascript/JS libraries such as floatr & d3 will be what I use.

### 5. JSON ### --COMPLETED--

This was doing all manner of things with PHP encoding and decoding JSON. This section is partially active as I've yet to do any JSON methods in Python.

### 6. REST Server ### --SCRAPPED, NO POINT--

Build a basic REST server to take, parse and respond to requests.

28/06/2016: REST services are used all over the place at work.

11/09/2016:
Building a REST server with Symfony is probably the most basic thing it could do. It's hardly worth actually writing one.

### 7. Docker ###

O'Reilly Media have a definitive guide to Docker, so I'll be going through the book - start to finish.

15/12/2016:
DevOps Engineer is slowly working on moving to Docker. It will become a requirement to line up environments eventually.

### 8. PHP Mentoring ### --SCRAPPED DUE TO EMPLOYMENT: LEAD ENGINEER MORE THAN SUFFICIENT--

Probably the biggest goal of the list - acquire a PHP mentor that's right for me, who I can give something back to. I want to competently master the concepts listed, and with no platform to discuss problems in day to day life, I really must turn to mentoring.

### 9. Open Source Contribution ###

It's a community. One sure fire way of gaining experience is getting hooked on taking other people's software apart, testing it and pushing it back to git. It's the kind of thing that I dreamed about when I was 10 years old.

Update 01/05/2016: Pushed tiny change to a repo, my first. Got merged. On the right track!

### 10. Python Mastering ### --IN PROGRESS--

I have a Raspberry Pi. I have a book on Python. It's time to get coding with a secondry language, and I've chosen Python over Java, Node.JS and any other languages.

15/12/2016:
As discussed with the Engineer, this is actually a very pointless goal. Considering PHP is going in the right direction with 7 and is developing at a good speed, there is no point sidestepping to a different language. The only secondry language I am going to need will be JavaScript, and that will be for visualisations in data. If one tool is sufficient, become a master of it rather than spread language knowledge.

20/12/2016:
I have changed my mind about this. As my girlfriend learns Python for her work, I'm going to learn it with her. I have a server side language to master (i.e PHP), a front end tool in Javascript to learn the basics (mainly for dashboard widgets to be honest) and now my general purpose will be Python.

### 11. Design Patterns ###

Armed with a book now showing design patterns, I need to work my way through key concepts in patterns which will make learning new languages far easier. So, for the time being, these are:

1. Build a Strategic app that takes the core concepts of encapsulation and interfacing
2. Build an Observer app that builds in a pre-PHP-API event/listener model
3. Build a Factory Application
4. Build an Abstract Factory Application
5. Build a Command Application
