# PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS

### 1. Competence of Symfony --IN PROGRESS-- ###

Changing from traditional "spaghetti" applications written in PHP to proper frameworks using advanced tools has been a major step. Every new developer for in this discipline must adopt a starting language and subsequent framework. My language choice was PHP. Symfony is my preferred framework. There is no concrete reason for this, other than quite a few networking discussions with other developers about the learning curve of Zend Framework being sharper. It is possible I may learn Laravel in time, but for me, Symfony is widely used, I've had training from SensioLabs and am comfortable it's taking me forward.

Concepts of Symfony

- Implimentation of Service Containers
- Full example use of Doctrine to CRUD from Symfony to MySQL
- Integration of Twitter bootstrap to speed up form and web development
- Understanding of multiple controllers and multiple routes in YAML markup

These concepts will be proved from fresh code on a basic project hosted here.

08/03/2016:
Sandbox Symfony is installed and uploaded to GIT. Revisiting training from Inviqua to go through the Symfony getting stated guide.

20/04/2016:
Work started to create a form to take HTTP POST data and turn it into an object.

### 2. PHP Unit ###

I tried Netbeans integration with this and it was very confusing, and contradicted PHPunit's own Implimentation guidelines. PHPUnit out the box is seems the best route. I can't get it to work, I need an create an application specifically to write unit tests.

### 3. Revisit the basics of OOP in PHP --COMPLETED--

I STILL haven't had that magic click where I can read methods, objects and constructors like they're in English. CodeAcademy does a free course on this, I WILL master this until I can read it automatically.

Edit - scores of OOP concepts are starting to make sense after reading up on this before putting it into practice. The following article gives the basic outline, and it's really set me on the right track:
http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/object-oriented-php-for-beginners--net-12762

I've been working with so much software using these methods without understanding them it's unreal. Syntax like magic method constructors are now starting to make complete sense.

08/03/2016:
TO DO FOR THIS CORE CONCEPT:
1. Finish CodeAcademy PHP in it's entirity
2. Read and perform "PHP Master - Write Cutting Edge Code" by Mitchell, Turland & Shafik.
3. Write code with full comment markup to show OOP in practise and dump it into the 'OOP' folder of this repository.
4. 
16/03/2016:
Almost finished CodeAcademy. About to write OOP document which will be written up and coded with examples of OOP through classes, class extensions, class constructors and constants.

### 4. Interactive BIRT Objects ### --SCRAPPED DUE TO EMPLOYMENT--

I have made fairly big roads into OpenText's BIRT reporting Engine, which runs through Eclipse. These objects are saved as a sprawl of XML markup. According to one of OpenText's own Technical Officers, these objects can be imported into other applications. The BIRT engine can handle interactivity and dymanic parameters, so the aim is to get one of these into a Symfony application.

28/06/2016: My employment means there is no need for this, which is a little niche. Day to day dashboards and stats will be compiled with processed GET requests spitting out JSON for rendering in Google charts.

### 5. JSON ### --IN PROGRESS--

Run a tutorial pumping data into and out of a JSON file - get to grips with the format and what it does.

28/06/2016: JSON is being used in almost all the RESTful usage at work.

### 6. REST Server ### --IN PROGRESS--

Build a basic REST server to take, parse and respond to requests.

28/06/2016: REST services are used all over the place at work.

### 7. Docker ###

O'Reilly Media have a definitive guide to Docker, so I'll be going through the book - start to finish.

### 8. PHP Mentoring ###

Probably the biggest goal of the list - acquire a PHP mentor that's right for me, who I can give something back to. I want to competently master the concepts listed, and with no platform to discuss problems in day to day life, I really must turn to mentoring.

### 9. Open Source Contribution ###

It's a community. One sure fire way of gaining experience is getting hooked on taking other people's software apart, testing it and pushing it back to GIT. It's the kind of thing that I dreamed about when I was 10 years old.

Update 01/05/2016: Pushed tiny change to a repo, my first. Got merged. On the right track!

### 10. Python Mastering ###

I have a Raspberry Pi. I have a book on Python. It's time to get coding with a secondry language, and I've chosen Python over Java, Node.JS and any other languages.
