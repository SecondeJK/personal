Write a function:

function solution($n);

that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 3, 5 or 7 should be replaced by the word Fizz, Buzz or Woof respectively.

If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 3, 5 or 7, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Fizz, Buzz and Woof in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 should be replaced by FizzBuzz and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 3, 5 and 7, should be replaced by FizzBuzzWoof.

For example, here is the output for N = 24:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
Woof
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
Woof
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
FizzWoof
22
23
Fizz

The function shouldn't return any value.

Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..1,000].
In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
